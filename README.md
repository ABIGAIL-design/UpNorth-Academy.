# UpNorth Academy Platform

Welcome to the official open-source repository for **UpNorth Academy** – a hybrid learning platform designed to empower underrepresented communities with foundational and advanced digital skills.

## 🌍 About the Project
UpNorth Academy provides a blended learning experience combining offline instructor-led training with online tools for assignments, assessments, and learning materials. Our platform is especially optimized for learners in low-bandwidth regions and supports mobile-first users.

### ✅ Currently Implemented:
- **Hybrid Learning Model (Offline + Online):**  
  We deliver instructor-led in-person sessions supported by online tools (e.g., WhatsApp, Google Forms, and simple learning management tools) for assignments, materials, and assessments. This approach increases access while ensuring mentorship, especially in communities with limited digital exposure.

  ### 🚧 Upcoming Features (In Development):
- **Open Source Web Platform:**  
  We plan to build a platform using modern web technologies (React, Firebase/Node.js) and host it publicly on GitHub under an open-source license.

- **Mobile-Responsive Interface:**  
  The web platform will be optimized for both smartphones and desktops, especially for learners without laptops.

- **Progressive Web App (PWA):**  
  Planned to support offline access to learning content after the initial load — useful for low-connectivity areas.

- **Data Analytics Integration:**  
  Future integration will include tools like Firebase Analytics or open-source alternatives to track learner engagement and outcomes.

- **Scalable Modular Design:**  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
